## Fixed Issues

### ISSUE-001: Demo app fails to render — blank page with JS runtime errors on load

**Status:** FIXED

**Root causes identified and fixed:**
1. `packages/node-web-shims/src/vite-plugin.ts` had a broken `unenv/runtime/node/` resolution block that caused `EventEmitter` to be undefined during Vite pre-bundling. Removed the incorrect resolution.
2. `apps/demo/vite.config.ts` had an additional broken alias mapping `unenv/runtime/node/*` to `*/index.mjs`. Removed.
3. `packages/node-web-shims/package.json` was missing exports for `./dist/*` files, causing esbuild pre-bundling to fail when aliasing `node:events` etc. Added `"./dist/*": "./dist/*"` export.
4. `packages/sw-sandbox/src/sw-sandbox.ts` waited for an unreliable `SW_READY` broadcast from the service worker. Fixed by using a `MessageChannel` `PORT_READY` acknowledgment.
5. `apps/demo/public/sw.js` was missing a `fetch` event listener entirely. Added the handler to proxy requests through the sandbox.
6. `packages/runtime/src/boot.ts` hardcoded the sandbox origin to `https://sandbox.local/`. Fixed to use `globalThis.location?.origin`.
7. `packages/sw-sandbox/src/sw-sandbox.ts` `handleFetchRequest` passed an empty string body to GET/HEAD requests, causing `Request` construction to fail. Added a guard to only include body for non-GET/HEAD methods.
8. `packages/vite-server/src/browser-vite-server.ts` used dynamic `import('typescript')` via `@sebastianwessel/quickjs`, which fails in browser bundles. Rewrote to use static `import * as ts from 'typescript'` and `ts.transpile()` directly.
9. `packages/runtime/src/shell-service.ts` did not use `BrowserViteServer` for `npm run dev`. Updated to instantiate and start `BrowserViteServer`, enabling TSX transformation and importmap injection.
10. `apps/demo/src/Preview.tsx` used `credentialless` on the iframe, which creates a separate network partition that bypasses the parent's Service Worker. Removed `credentialless` and added `allow-same-origin` to the sandbox so SW interception works for iframe navigation.

### ISSUE-002: Page title does not match spec

**Status:** FIXED

`apps/demo/index.html` title changed from `"browser-containers demo"` to `"browser-containers"`.

## Validation Results

The following v0.2.0-react-vite.spec checks were verified via a Playwright-based dogfood session:

- Page title is `"browser-containers"` :white_check_mark:
- Service worker registers and is active :white_check_mark:
- npm install auto-populates VFS (react exists, importmap exists) :white_check_mark:
- Preview iframe displays `Hello from browser-containers!` :white_check_mark:
- Preview hot-reload works (`Updated!` appears after file change) :white_check_mark:
- TSX transformation works (no raw JSX in fetched module) :white_check_mark:

## Infrastructure Verification

- E2E shared lib extracted (`tests/e2e/lib/ab.ts`, `config.ts`, `setup.ts`)
- Step files refactored to use shared lib
- Screenshot-on-failure capability added
- CI workflow uses `DEMO_URL` env var
- Gauge config synced (`html-report` in `gauge.properties`)
- `agent-browser` bumped to `^0.25.5`
- Root `package.json` has `test:e2e` and `test:e2e:verbose` scripts

## Evidence

All 277 unit tests pass (`pnpm test`). Build (`pnpm build`) and typecheck (`pnpm typecheck`) are clean.
