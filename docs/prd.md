# @browser-containers — Product Requirements Document

## Vision

A fully client-side, drop-in Node.js/Bun/Deno runtime for the browser. Developers drop their existing project into browser-containers and it works — no lockfile conversion, no CLI replacement, no workarounds. Zero server dependency. FOSS, modular, and designed for early funding.

The project is also the foundation for AI agent platforms that need sandboxed, observable JavaScript execution with resource controls.

## Compatibility Tiers

browser-containers targets three compatibility tiers. Each tier has a different shim requirement and a different user proposition.

| Tier | Label | Shim required? | Covers |
|------|-------|----------------|--------|
| T1 | **Web-Standard** | No | Packages built on `fetch`, `ReadableStream`, `WebCrypto`, `URL`, etc. Hono, Elysia, itty-router, and most modern edge-first frameworks. **These run out of the box with zero shims.** |
| T2 | **WinterTC / ECMA-429** | No (Web APIs) | The [ECMA-429](https://min-common-api.proposal.wintertc.org/) minimum common Web API set. ~85-90% covered via native browser APIs + `node-web-shims`. Gaps: `navigator.userAgent`, `unhandledrejection` event (each <20 lines to close). |
| T3 | **Node-API via shims** | Yes | Packages that import `node:*` builtins. 28 builtins covered via two layers: `node-web-shims` (22 Web-API bridges via unenv) and `node-runtime-shims` (6 runtime-backed factories for `fs`, `http`, `net`, `child_process`, `process`, `module`). ~85-90% of real-world npm surface. |

### Tier 1: Web-Standard (100% coverage)

Packages written entirely against Web Standards: `fetch`, `Request`, `Response`, `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, `SubtleCrypto`, `URL`, `Blob`, `FormData`, `CompressionStream`, `TextEncoder/TextDecoder`, `BroadcastChannel`, `MessageChannel`, `AbortController`, `WebAssembly.*`, `setTimeout`, `queueMicrotask`, `structuredClone`.

**Coverage: 100%.** No shims needed. Libraries like Hono, Elysia, and itty-router run unmodified. The bundle contains zero shim bindings. This is the headline tier for marketing: *"Web-standard libraries run out of the box — no Node shims required."*

### Tier 2: WinterTC / ECMA-429 (~85-90% coverage)

The [WinterCG](https://wintertc.org/) minimum common Web platform API standard, formalized as [ECMA-429](https://min-common-api.proposal.wintertc.org/) by Ecma TC55. This is the API surface every non-browser JS runtime agrees to provide. Coverage is via native browser APIs plus `node-web-shims`. Marketing claim: "ECMA-429 2025 snapshot-aligned." When the official WPT subset test suite is published, a precise compliance percentage will be published.

### Tier 3: Node-API via shims (~85-90% coverage)

Packages that import `node:*` builtins. Covered by:
- `node-web-shims`: 22 Web-API bridges (`path`, `buffer`, `url`, `crypto`, `os`, `events`, `stream`, `util`, `async_hooks`, `querystring`, `worker_threads`, `string_decoder`, `tty`, `assert`, `zlib`, `constants`, `perf_hooks`, `timers`, `punycode`, `diagnostics_channel`, `readline`)
- `node-runtime-shims`: 6 runtime-backed factories (`fs` → VfsBus, `child_process` → just-bash/WASM, `process` → process shim, `module` → createRequire, `http` → VirtualServer via sw-sandbox, `net` → createHttpShim)

### Tier 4: Intentionally Unsupported

These require capabilities a browser cannot provide safely or at all. All fail with a clear, documented reason.

| Capability | Why unsupported |
|-----------|----------------|
| `cluster` | No shared port binding between Workers |
| `fork()` / real POSIX fork | No shared memory (CoW) between Workers |
| Raw TCP / `dgram` | Browser sandbox — no raw socket API |
| `tls.createServer()` | No inbound TLS on raw sockets |
| `https.createServer()` | Same as `tls.createServer()` |
| Native `.node` addons | No native binary execution |
| `inspector` (Chrome DevTools protocol) | No TCP server binding in browser |
| `test` runner | Requires PTY + `child_process` + file watching |
| `repl` | Requires PTY / TTY — no browser equivalent |
| Hardlink-based CAS (`pnpm` store, `vltpkg` cache) | OPFS and Filesystem Access API have no `fs.linkSync` |

**Emulable with reduced fidelity (T3-level):**
- `child_process.spawn()` — emulated via Web Worker with message-passing IPC. Not true fork; covers "run script in subprocess and capture output."
- `vm` — shimmed via QuickJS `js.eval()` (the sandbox pool already has QuickJS)
- `https` client — shimmed via `fetch` (TLS is built in)
- `dns` — shimmed via DoH (Cloudflare `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query`)
- `fs.watch` — coarse polling via `setInterval` + `stat` diffing (dev-tool quality, not production)
- `process.memoryUsage()` — best-effort via `performance.memory` (Chrome-only) or ArrayBuffer enumeration

## Architecture

### Two-tier runtime

- **Trusted tier (V8, main realm):** User code runs here via `data:` import. Full Node compatibility surface via shims. Executes in the main browser context.
- **Untrusted tier (QuickJS, sandbox pool):** AI agent code runs here. Sandboxed via QuickJS isolate + `sandbox-policy` ACLs (CPU, memory, filesystem, network limits). Route: `transformScript` (esbuild TS strip) → QuickJS `evalCode`. Strips types, enforces sandbox policy.

### Virtual filesystem

Two-layer VFS: **memfs** (synchronous, hot, in-memory) + **OPFS** (asynchronous, persistent, cold). All writes go to both layers. Reads check hot first, fall back to cold.

### ServiceWorker network proxy

ServiceWorker intercepts all traffic on the virtual origin (`sandbox.localhost`). Outbound: `fetch()` calls reach real registries. Inbound: serves the virtual server on virtual localhost. No real server needed.

### Package management

- **npm:** `npm-in-browser` (the real `npm/cli` compiled to ESM with Node globals shimmed at build time). Reads and writes `package-lock.json`.
- **yarn / pnpm / bun:** `@unjs/lockfile` reads the existing lockfile (`yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`, `bun.lockb`) and produces a normalized dependency graph. The `PackageManager` with `'lockfile-only'` strategy fetches tarballs via `fetch()` and writes to the VFS. No real CLI needed.
- **JSR:** `jsr:` specifiers resolve via `npm.jsr.io` (Deno's JSR npm-compatibility mirror). Bundler-level `jsr:` alias plugin rewrites imports.
- **esm.sh:** CDN fallback for transitive dependencies not in `node_modules`.

## Scope (v1)

### In scope

- Three-tier Node.js compatibility (T1 Web-Standard, T2 WinterTC/ECMA-429, T3 Node-API via shims)
- `node:fs`, `node:crypto`, `node:stream`, `node:http`, `node:path`, `node:buffer`, `node:url`, `node:events`, `node:os`, `node:child_process`, `node:worker_threads`, `node:module`, `node:process`, `node:net`, plus 20+ more via `node-web-shims`
- Multi-format lockfile compatibility (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) via `@unjs/lockfile`
- Virtual filesystem backed by memfs (hot) + OPFS (cold)
- ServiceWorker-based network proxy for virtual localhost
- WASM-based tool registry (esbuild, tsc, sass, swc)
- Vite dev server running in the browser
- Two-tier runtime: V8 (user code) + QuickJS (AI agents)
- Opt-in sandbox policy with network, memory, CPU, and filesystem restrictions
- Backend framework compatibility: Hono, Express, Koa, Fastify, Elysia, Nitro, tRPC
- Vendored Node.js test suite harness as the primary compatibility metric
- Live compatibility dashboard published to GitHub Pages

### Out of scope (v1)

- Next.js App Router, Pages Router (requires server-side features)
- Webpack (requires `require()` node_modules walking, eval, and plugin hooks unavailable in browsers)
- `cluster` module (no shared port binding in browsers)
- `fork()` / real POSIX fork (no shared memory between Workers)
- `dgram` / raw UDP sockets (no browser API)
- `tls` / `https` server (no inbound TLS without raw sockets)
- Native `.node` addons (no native binary execution)
- Raw TCP sockets (no browser API)
- ShadowRealm / sandboxed iframe as a third isolation tier (V8 + QuickJS dual-tier is sufficient)
- `inspector` module (Chrome DevTools protocol server — requires TCP)
- `test` runner (requires PTY + `child_process`)
- `repl` (requires PTY)
- SSR / Server Components
- Hardlink-based content-addressable stores (browser filesystem has no `fs.linkSync`)

## Target Users

1. **Developers** who want to try Node.js libraries in the browser without setup, or who want to embed a browser-native runtime in their product
2. **AI agent platforms** that need sandboxed, observable JavaScript execution with resource controls (opencode, claude-code, pi-agent)
3. **Educators** who need zero-install Node.js environments for teaching
4. **Tooling authors** who want to run Node.js-based build tools (esbuild, vite, tsc) in-browser without a server

## Package Manager Compatibility

| Package manager | Lockfile read | CLI runnable | Strategy |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **npm** | ✅ `package-lock.json` | ✅ (via npm-in-browser) | Native |
| **yarn v1** | ✅ `yarn.lock` | ❌ | `@unjs/lockfile` → fetch tarballs |
| **pnpm** | ✅ `pnpm-lock.yaml` | ❌ | `@unjs/lockfile` → fetch tarballs |
| **bun** | ✅ `bun.lock` / `bun.lockb` | ❌ | `@unjs/lockfile` → fetch tarballs |
| **JSR** | N/A | N/A | `npm.jsr.io` mirror + `jsr:` alias |

**Note:** All four lockfile formats produce an identical install graph. A project with a `yarn.lock` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` works in browser-containers without any conversion — the lockfile is read, resolved, and tarballs are fetched directly from the `resolved:` URLs already in the lockfile.

## Modularity

The project is structured as a pnpm monorepo. Each package is independently consumable:

- `@browser-containers/vfs-bus` — standalone VFS (memfs + OPFS)
- `@browser-containers/node-web-shims` — 22 `node:*` → Web API bridges (unenv-backed, works in any project)
- `@browser-containers/node-runtime-shims` — runtime-backed shim factories
- `@browser-containers/sandbox-policy` — ACL-based sandbox policy
- `@browser-containers/wasm-registry` — WASM tool loader (esbuild, tsc, sass, swc)
- `@browser-containers/runtime` — container API (RuntimeWorker + SandboxPool)
- **`@unjs/lockfile`** — standalone, framework-agnostic multi-format lockfile parser (published to npm, MIT, zero browser-containers deps)
